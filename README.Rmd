# mypkg

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mypkg is to test the R package development during the ISPED summer school.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of mypkg from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("melaniehuchon/mypkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mypkg)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r example code}
matrice <- cbind(c(1,2), c(3,4))
mean <- c(1, 1)
varcov <- diag(1, 2)
mvnpdf(x = matrice, mean = mean, varcovM = varcov)
```
